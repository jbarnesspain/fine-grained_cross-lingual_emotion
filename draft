A cross-linguistic comparison 
of fine-grained emotion detection in tweets
 
1. State-of-the-art 

1.1 Emotion detection  

Emotion detection in written texts is based on the analysis of the information and the retrieval of sentiment explicitly or implicitly included in the text. Some written messages such as hotel or restaurant reviews hold an obvious opinion (either positive or negative, even neutral sometimes) relying on certain expressions or words. In order to extract information, we can perform either an automatic or a manual analysis by labelling texts with positive or negative sentiment degrees. This labelling is known as coarse-grained analysis, which is a general study of the texts. However, a fine-grained analysis can also be performed and consists on extracting the emotion that the author intends to express or the emotional state in which the author wrote the text. The psychologist Paul Ekman proposes a discrete set of six basic emotions derived from universal facial expressions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise. This theory is widely used for manual and automatic emotion annotation and it is useful for different implementations where it is necessary to differentiate between emotions. For instance, while anger and sadness are both negative emotions, distinguishing between them can be important so businesses can filter out angry customers and respond to them effectively (Jasy Liew Suet Yan, Howard R. Turtle, 2016).

1.2 Methods 

The methodologies used to annotate emotion are divided, as mentioned before, into manual and automatic annotation. In order to use machine learning for emotion detection the text needs to be preprocessed, normalized, tokenized, etc. to form a bag-of-words useful for the algorithms to classify the information. Some texts are especially difficult for this task given that language is ambiguous and the detection of emotion keywords is not a 100% accurate.
On the other hand, there are manual techniques used for fine-grained detection such as Best-Worst Scaling (BWS). The BWS method is an alternative method of annotation that is claimed to produce high-quality annotations while keeping the required number of annotations similar to that of rating scales” (Kiritchenko and Mohammad 2017). Essentially, “annotators are given four items (4-tuple) and asked which item is the Best (highest in terms of the property of interest) and which is the Worst (least in terms of the property of interest)” (Kiritchenko and Mohammad 2016). This technique has been used to annotate English and Arabic tweets with one of the six Ekman emotions. Regarding languages other than English, which is obviously one of the most resourceful languages within the NLP field, there have been other approaches “dealing with the sentiment detection in three different languages - French, German and Spanish - using three distinct Machine Translation (MT) systems - Bing, Google and Moses (Alexandra Balahur and Marco Turchi, 2012). Following the promising conclusions reached by these approaches which “show that machine translation systems are mature enough to be employed for multilingual sentiment analysis” (Alexandra Balahur and Marco Turchi, 2012) we take into consideration that there is a lack of manually-annotated tweet corpus in Spanish and especially in Catalan that captures a diversity of emotion expressions at a fine-grained level. Hence, we consider important to compare emotion detection using annotated tweets in Spanish and Catalan which are then translated into English by different machine translation tools (unsupervised and semi-supervised) in order to find out whether we can extract the same results in all three languages.

It is remarkable that the data set to be annotated is compounded by tweets given that it is a social network where people express their emotions and opinions regarding a great diversity of genres - social or personal events, news, facilities, politics, etc. Also, “emotion-word hashtags are good manual labels of emotions in tweets” because they are “given by the tweeters themselves to their own messages, and corresponding to their own emotions at the time the message was composed” (Saif M. Mohammad and Svetlana Kiritchenko, 2013).
In fact, using machine learning techniques for fine-grained emotion detection in twitter is particularly challenging since the language used in twitter usually contains “abbreviations, acronyms, emoticons, unusual orthographic elements, slang, and misspellings” (Jasy Liew Suet Yan, Howard R. Turtle, 2016).
